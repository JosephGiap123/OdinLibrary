This is my Odin Project Library project for the Javascript Section!

As of July 21st 2025, the following features are implemented:
- Adding books with validation checking, unique IDs.
- Sorting of books using their properties.
- Deleting specific books
- Ability to mark a book as read or not

Future ideas once getting through course:
- Store library in Localstorage until a more elegant solution
  - The more elegant solution would involve databases and logins.
- Actual ability to go to book pages and read "dummy" text
  - Eventual attaching to an API with free source books.
- Ability to check out books/explore books
- Implement the photos for each book
